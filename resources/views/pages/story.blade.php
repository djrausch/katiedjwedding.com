                <p>DJ & Katie met during a mutual friend’s birthday dinner at Reilly Craft Pizza in downtown Tucson.
                    DJ was
                    aware that matchmaking plans were already laid out for the two of them, but Katie had no clue
                    whatsoever. Thanks to Genevieve, Davis, and Lauren, DJ had a solid wing-team set up for the
                    night.</p>

                <p>The early evening progressed like a dream. DJ noticed Katie’s pleasantly soft chortle (har-har)
                    from
                    down the street as she and Genevieve ambled nearer. The sight of her flowing brown hair and
                    patchwork
                    dress had him swooning. Then Katie introduced herself to the rest of the group, first hugging
                    Lauren
                    then shaking Davis’s hand. Lastly she took DJ’s hand, looked into his eyes, and the world around
                    them
                    seemed to stop. She thought, “this is the most beautiful face I have ever seen, who in the world
                    is this
                    person?!”</p>
                Alas, the wing-team never got their chance to show off their lucky bachelor… the two were already in
                love. In summary, the evening progressed as follows:
                <ol>
                    <li>DJ sits next to Katie at the dinner table.</li>
                    <li>Katie inquires by text to Lauren if DJ is single. According to her, he is! Lovely, she
                        thinks,
                        I’ll buy him a drink.
                    </li>
                    <li>Dinner wraps up and the group moves on to Congress.</li>
                    <li>DJ drinks too much within the first 10 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Lauren tells DJ, after he’s drunk, that Katie likes him.</li>
                    <li>DJ gets scared because he is too drunk to impress a lady.</li>
                    <li>Katie doesn’t know DJ is drunk. Katie buys DJ another drink.</li>
                    <li>DJ is too drunk to drink Katie’s offertory beverage. He turns to Davis and whimpers, “Save
                        me.”
                    </li>
                    <li>DJ sobers up eventually.</li>
                    <li>Katie dances awkwardly to LCD Soundsystem essentially by herself (she hasn’t been drinking
                        because she is DD. She’s just awkward).
                    </li>
                    <li>DJ and Katie talk for the rest of the night.</li>
                    <li>Katie drops DJ off at his apartment, expecting that he will ask for her number.</li>
                    <li>DJ asks her if she would like to go out to dinner.</li>
                    <li>Katie wasn’t expecting that he liked her enough to ask her to dinner right off the bat, so
                        she
                        paused for a painfully long moment, wondering how to respond.
                    </li>
                    <li>Katie eventually recovered from her awe of this young man’s gentility, and replied, “Yes, I
                        would like that very much.”
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                But Katie couldn’t wait until their date to hang out with DJ, so she invited him to yoga with
                friends.
                They all had a blast. Finally they went dinner at a favorite restaurant, The B Line. They both
                laughed
                that night until their cheeks hurt, pausing their hand-holding only to massage their own faces. The
                two
                have been inseparable ever since.
